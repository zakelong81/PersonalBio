PersonalBio

For the first project, you will create a website to represent yourself in an online portfolio format.
Your website should start with a general introduction that gives the reader a brief introduction to who you are, including your major, what year you aim to graduate, along with any other relevant information that describes you. The website should also have other pages for each of the three topics:
1.	Interests - share your hobbies and/or interests, anything from what career you want to pursue to your favorite music
2.	Computing Biography - describe what previous experiences you have (if any) and what motivated you to take a course in web development
3.	Development Portfolio - on this page, provide a link to your GitHub account (should be https://github.com/YourUserName) and links to the repositories you have made for the exercises you have completed so far in class. For each link, also provide a brief description of what they demonstrate.
The website should meet the following technical requirements:
•	Altogether, the website should have four HTML files, all in the same folder
•	The general introduction page should be named index.html
•	All HTML should be valid HTML5 code
•	Each HTML file should have your full name in a comment element after the DOCTYPE element
•	The HTML files should show good use of indentation and style shown in class so it is easy to read
o	Child elements need to be indented from their parents
o	Long lines of code should be separated into multiple lines of code
•	All style should be applied in a single, dedicated CSS file, not inline CSS nor internal style in an html file
•	All pages should have a cohesive design, so that they look like they belong to a website (and not looking like 4 separate websites)
•	Each of the four HTML pages should link to all other pages so that from anywhere in your bio website, you can reach anywhere else with one click. Hint: creating a navigation bar that you use on each page is one way to achieve this
•	Demonstrate appropriate use of:
o	HTML text through use of headings, paragraphs, and lists (at least one of each)
o	HTML blocks through use of divs and spans (at least one of each)
o	Images (use your own or if taken from another source, provide a link to the page where you found it immediately under the image with a link that looks like this: [Image Source]. If you know the author/creator of the image, provide their name as well.
o	CSS rules for (at least one of each): element, id, class, pseudo-class, and combinator
To get started:
FIRST, go to your GitHub account and create a New Repository. Give it a name such as PersonalBio and make it Public. You do not need to select anything else on the Create a New Repository page.
Next, once your repository has been made, you will copy the Clone URL. Open GitKraken and (as you have before), choose to clone the repo and provide the URL you just copied after choosing a folder on your computer where you'd like to save this project.
In Atom, start by creating a new file and naming it index.html by choosing to Save As..., identifying the folder GitKraken just created by cloning, and specifying the file name.
At this time, you should be able to go back to GitKraken and it should show your index.html file as "unstaged." Stage and commit the file to create an initial (incomplete) version of your project. Push to make a backup copy of it on GitHub.
Now, every time you create or change a file in that same folder, GitKraken should allow you to Stage, Commit, and Push your latest version. It's a good idea to periodically create new versions of your project so that you have a back-up copy in case anything happens. Only your last version will be graded, so don't worry about intermediate versions not being "finished."
Publishing in your work:
FIRST, stage, commit, and push your work to your GitHub repo.
Then, go to your GitHub repo in your web browser, log in (if you are not already), and choose Settings. Scroll down until you see the section for "GitHub Pages." Below the Source dropdown, choose Master branch and press Save. The page will refresh. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section again and it will list a Pages URL. Copy that URL and open it in a new web browser tab and you should see your index.html page displayed. This is your published website!
If you don't see your index.html page displayed, there are two possible reasons: (1) GitHub may just be operating slowly and try refreshing the Pages URL a few minutes later, or (2) you did not create a file called index.html in your repository. Keep in mind it should NOT be in a sub-directory within the repository and the file name should be in all lower case.
Turning in your work:
As a Text Submission, copy and paste BOTH of the following:
Your GitHub repository URL for the project (e.g. https://github.com/YourUserName/YourProjectName)
Your Pages URL for the project (e.g. https://YourUserName.github.io/YourProjectName)
Keep in mind that only your latest Push will be graded, and if your latest Push is after the deadline, then your work is late!
